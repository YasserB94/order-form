# Order Form
A BeCode learning challenge for PHP.
Trough this exercise I will learn how to use PHP to dynamicly update the website as a user enters information in a form.
No database implementation is required for this exercise.
## Goals
_This is a personal interpretation of the challenge creating a step by step plan to follow to achieve the requested result_
1. Create a concept for a store that can have a webshop
    [ ] Have a name
    [ ] Have a set of products to sell
    [ ] Have an alternative set of products to sell
2. Accept orders
    [ ] Have an order confirmation screen when the form is submitted
3. Valide the form - **!SERVER SIDE!**
    [ ] Required fields may not be empty
    [ ] The adress is valid
    [ ] The E-Mail adress is valid 
        [ ] Invalid ? Show an alert!
            [ ] Maintain the previously entered values in the form
        [ ] Valid ? Show the confirmation box!
4. Improve the user experience with PHP Super globals
    [ ] Explore session and Cookies to improve the UX
        - For example: Prefill the adress as long as the browser isn't closed.
        - Keep the user's previous choices on the website as long as the user hasn't checked out.
## Stretch Goals
_This is my interpretation of the 'extra' challenges within the learning challenge_
1. Expand
    [ ] Create a toggle that switches the site to a different set of products.
2. Bulk Orders
    [ ] Allow the user to buy multiple instances of a product
3. Look & Feel
    [ ] Style the site using html/css
    [ ] Improve the validation with html/js
## Progress
1. The Concept
Due to the lack of inspiration let's take a random bar in Antwerp that also sells some food items.
